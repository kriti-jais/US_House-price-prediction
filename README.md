Objective: To analyze publicly available data on economic, demographic, and real estate indicators to build a predictive model that explains the impact of these factors on the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a key indicator of the U.S. home prices over the last two decades.
Introduction:
Housing market has always been a strong case to study not only for its dependability and dynamics on various factors, but also for the fact that it impacts people’s lives and livelihood in a big way. Price levels of homes in the United States can be studied well by following the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. Housing market is generally affected by multiple factors and if one wants to monitor and understand the dynamics of home prices, these indices offer reliable and valuable insights into the ever-changing housing market. A key component of this system is the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.  Its comprehensive insight of the overall value of the single-family homes provides very valuable input to homebuyers nationwide. The way it works is by aggregating data from nine different regions of the nation. Furthermore, it updates data on a monthly basis. It also offers average price changes in specific geographic markets, covering 20 major metropolitan areas. People benefit from these indices by focusing on these city indices. Structurally, these areas are further grouped into two composites, one with 10 metro areas and the other that encompasses all 20. These indices have been built to measure percentage variations in housing market prices. However, these indices also maintain a constant level of quality. This is done by ensuring that variations due to factors such as house types, sizes, or physical characteristics are excluded from the calculations. This makes it a very much reliable index.
Supply Side Factors That Affect Home Prices
Important factors that affect the supply of houses available for sale are discussed below:
Months of Supply
Months of supply is one of the basic measures of supply. It tells how many months it would take for the current inventory of homes to sell. It quantifies the supply and demand in the housing market. Houses for sale is another measure of the same.

Unemployment
Unemployment  is one of the key factors that affect both demand and supply in the real estate market. A high rate of unemployment means that people do not have the money to spend on houses. It may also mean that there is a dip in the investment side, and hence lower supply. Fear of unemployment where people are not really unemployed, but think they may lose their employment, can cause a deep impact in the real estate market.

Mortgage Rate
Mortgage rates are one of the biggest factors that work as a pulse of the housing industry. It can simply predict how well the real estate market will or will not perform. It is such a factor that it actually plugs into both supply and demand side of the equation. It impacts the options of availability of finance to buyers. It eases the inflow of finance for new constructions. Another aspect is the delinquency rate and the number of refinances for mortgages, which it affects. People are more likely to default on a higher mortgage rate. However, too low mortgage rate can create imbalance in the supply side as there could be demands outgrowing the supply.

Federal Funds Rate
This comes into direct play when the Federal Funds Rate makes a direct dent into the housing market. Although mortgage rate and Federal Funds Rate are usually closely related, sometimes they may not be. There have been instances in the past when the Federal Government lowered the Fed Funds Rate, but banks did not reciprocate by lowering mortgage rates for multiple reasons. Sometimes the lowering happened, but did not complement each other by being proportionately lowered. Variations in the Federal Funds Rate influence the economy in many ways, not just the real estate market. Many of these factors again indirectly influence the real estate market. So the Fed Funds Rate impacts the housing market in a complex way.

USA GDP
The GDP is a measure of the health of the economy, including the output of the overall economy. An economy that is doing well is usually indicated by healthy GDP and its year on year growth. This implies more investment and economic activity, and more buying. Housing sector also follows the same trend as the overall GDP.

Building Permits
By measuring the number of building permits allotted one can not only predict just the health of real estate industry, but also how free the real estate market is. It is an indicator of the extent of regulation/de-regulation of the market. It affects the supply through ease of putting a new property on the market.

Housing Starts
This factor is a measure of the number of units of new housing projects started in a given period. This is either measured in terms of the number of units or in valuation of housing projects started in a given period.

Construction Spending
The amount of money spent (in millions of USD, seasonally adjusted) in the housing industry, is a measure of the activity in that industry. It is also an indicator of the supply that going to be available for future months.

Demand Side Factors That Affect Home Prices
Demand for housing is affected by many factors. Many of these factors also affect the supply side in the housing market. Below are a few factors that are prominent in influencing the demand for home buying.
Affordability: Wages & Disposable Personal Income
The “weakly earnings” are a measure of overall wages and earning of all employed persons.
The Disposable Personal Income is the other measure  of how much of the earning is actually available to an individual for expenditure. This is an important measure as it takes into account taxes.

Delinquency Rate on Mortgages
If one has to predict the number of foreclosures in real estate, one would look for the delinquency rate on housing mortgages. In the last economic recession, higher delinquency rate (higher than credit card delinquency rate) was a key indicator of the recession, the poorly performing industries, and the economic condition of the nation as a whole. It also indicates the feasibility of a homeowner to buy a house at a certain point of time. It also indicates the overall demand in the industry.

Personal Savings
People can save their money after making all the necessary expenses. Therefore, the savings are indicator of one’s own financial condition. The extent by which people are saving their money, matters in overall investments and capital availability. It is also a factor that decides the interest rate of loans (and not just the mortgage rate). It also signifies the comparison between people’s inclination to spend their money and save it for future use. This therefore proves to be a significant indicator of the demand for home ownership as well.

Behavioral Changes and Changes in Preferences
Going for a home ownership is a significant and important decision in one’s life. It is derived from a combination of factors including change in preferences and attitudes of people towards home buying. Change in cultural trends can be taken as a revealed metric of propensity for home buying.
There is another metric to track changes in preferences in home buying, and that is, personal consumption expenditure. However, there may not be a one to one correlation. For example, if expenditure is increasing, but not the homeownership, it would indicate a change in preferences towards home buying and ownership. It is quite possible that people prefer to rent a home than buying one. Hence, both of these parameters are used.
